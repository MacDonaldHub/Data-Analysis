To show my progess in learning data development, which includes the use of Microsoft Excel to Collect and Consolidate Data, Clean the Data by removing duplicates or blank cells and then create Pivot table and Charts
# Project Problem or Task:
You’re a Data Analyst working for the education tech company Udemy. You have been asked by your manager, Head of Curriculum at Udemy, to present the data on course revenue, and you have been provided with data on courses from different topics to understand where opportunities to increase revenue may lie, and track the performance of courses. Your manager has suggested encouraging Web Development courses to charge more because she believes that these are the most popular courses. She needs to send a report to the CEO in the next three weeks on how they will increase their next quarterly earnings.
# Project Description:
To Analyze Data on Excel and relay my findings from the Project data collected consists of four different Courses namely: Data Sheet Udemy Courses - Business Courses - an XLSX file; Data Sheet Udemy Courses - Design Courses – a CSV file; Data Sheet Udemy Courses - Music Courses – a CSV file; Data Sheet Udemy Courses - Web Development – a CSV file. My aim is to consolidate the data into one Xlsx file via extracting, cleaning, and transforming the given data to get it ready for the analysis. I achieved this using Microsoft Excel to carry out the Extraction, Transformation, Data query and analysis.
# Data Source:
The data source was from a Github repository link, as follows; https://github.com/Fabulousnani/Data-Developer-Bootcamp/blob/main/Data_Sheet_Udemy_Courses_-_Business_Courses.xlsx https://github.com/Fabulousnani/Data-Developer-Bootcamp/blob/main/Data_Sheet_Udemy_Courses_-_Design_Courses.csv https://github.com/Fabulousnani/Data-Developer-Bootcamp/blob/main/Data_Sheet_Udemy_Courses_-_Music_Courses.csv https://github.com/Fabulousnani/Data-Developer-Bootcamp/blob/main/Data_Sheet_Udemy_Courses_-_Web_Development.csv
# Project Design:
Below are the steps taken:
i. Extracting and Synchronizing the various data into 1 excel sheet
ii. Cleaning the data to ensure that there are no balcnk cells or duplicates
iii. Transfroming the synchronized and cleaned data
iv. Querying the data
v. Using If Function to sort the data to my desired state
vi. Using VLookup to pick the desired data set from the long list of columns found in the synchronized data and organize it
vii. Using pivot tables to clearly show the Total number of subscribers, average number of subscribers, average cost per subject at each level, average content duration and average rating per subject at each level
# Findings:![Visual Chart on Findings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110080287/183284880-5ad46b96-9f34-45eb-bf43-2b7670bf9bda.png)
I discovered as is seen in the visual chart above, that Web Development generates 63% of the entire company's revenue as well as having the most subscribers with the highest content duration. Graphics design was way ahead every other courses in rating which shows that Subscribers interest is high on it as well.
# Recommendation:
In my own humble opinion, i recommend that Web development and Graphics design be given optimum evaluation and its prices reviwed so as to grow the number of revenue hence increasing their next quarterly earnings
# Conclusion:
I hope that my gradual but consistent steps to approaching the project task as a Data development Bootcamp Student is going to also inspire others to pick interest in learning this softskill. I hope to gain more knowledge in the data development world
